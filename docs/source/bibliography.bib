abstract = "It is shown that a Gaussian measure in a given infinite-dimensional Banach space always admits an essentially unique Gaussian disintegration with respect to a given continuous linear operator. This covers a similar statement made earlier in [Lee and Wasilkowski, Approximation of linear functionals on a Banach space with a Gaussian measure, J. Complexity 2(1) (1986) 12–43.] for the case of finite-rank operators."

abstract = "We study pathwise invariances and degeneracies of random fields with motivating applications in Gaussian process modelling. The key idea is that a number of structural properties one may wish to impose a priori on functions boil down to degeneracy properties under well-chosen linear operators. We first show in a second order set-up that almost sure degeneracy of random field paths under some class of linear operators defined in terms of signed measures can be controlled through the two first moments. A special focus is then put on the Gaussian case, where these results are revisited and extended to further linear operators thanks to state-of-the-art representations. Several degeneracy properties are tackled, including random fields with symmetric paths, centred paths, harmonic paths, or sparse paths. The proposed approach delivers a number of promising results and perspectives in Gaussian process modelling. In a first numerical experiment, it is shown that dedicated kernels can be used to infer an axis of symmetry. Our second numerical experiment deals with conditional simulations of a solution to the heat equation, and it is found that adapted kernels notably enable improved predictions of non-linear functionals of the field such as its maximum."

abstract="Cross validation is an appropriate tool for testing interpolation methods: it consists of leaving out one data point at a time, and determining how well this point can be estimated from the other data. Cross validation is often used for testing ``moving neighborhood'' kriging models; in this case, each unknown value is predicted from a small number of surrounding data. In ``unique neighborhood'' kriging algorithms, each estimation uses all the available data; as a result, cross validation would spend much computer time. For instance, with ndata points it would cost at least the resolution of nsystems of n {\texttimes} nlinear equations (each with a different matrix).Here, we present a much faster method for cross validation in a unique neighborhood. Instead of solving nsystems n {\texttimes} n,it only requires the inversion of one n {\texttimes} nmatrix. We also generalized this method to leaving out several points instead of one.",
